\title{Prevalence and Relative Standard Errors by Counts}
\usage{
prevcounts(N, N_H, N_testR, N_R, DE_H = 1, DE_R = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Counts of total survey sample size(s) (vector/integer).}

\item{N_H}{Number of HIV positive found in survey(s) (vector/integer).}

\item{N_testR}{Number tested for recency in survey(s) (vector/integer).}

\item{N_R}{Number of recent cases in survey(s) (vector/integer).}

\item{DE_H}{Design effect of HIV prevalence test (vector/numeric), greater than or equal to 1. If multiple surveys are entered but only one design effect is specified, function assumes entered design effect is identical for both surveys.}

\item{DE_R}{Design effect of recency test (vector/numeric), greater than or equal to 1. If multiple surveys are entered but only one design effect is specified, function assumes entered design effect is identical for both surveys.}
}
\value{
Prevalences and relative standard errors. Design effects are assumed negligible unless user specifies otherwise.
